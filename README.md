# Git Users Finder

## This is my first project in React Native

---

This is the first version 1.0 of my app

To help me develope, command it:

```
    git clone https://github.com/marcelo-sl/gitusersapp.git
```

```
    cd gitreposapp
```

```
    yarn install
```

With your virtual device open run the command below (android or ios):

```
    react-native run-android
